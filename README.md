# Stable-Pair
Using the Stable Marriage problem for my Linear Data Structures course

A Stack Interface was used to make an Array Stack instead of the built in stack in java.
Doing this then made it possible to add more functions in the stack being used that are not implemented in the built in stack class.
The program would run a find the two persons that would be the best match at the time, then make them into an object together then saved in the stack.
Then it would run through each person and set them to have the best pair and backtrack if a better pair was then found.
